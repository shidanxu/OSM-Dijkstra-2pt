# OSM-Dijkstra-2pt
Takes in a shape file with roads and calculates the distance between two positions. Example shape file is taken from California roads.

Later will update the requirements to download.


## Imposm parser

Takes in a shape file (can modify in the top of imposmParser.py), and output a csv file of all roads and relevant data in data/filename

Note that the Imposm parser has many installation dependnecies, let me know if you experience any trouble. I can try to help.
